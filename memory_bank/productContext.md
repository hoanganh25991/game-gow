# Product Context

## Purpose
This document explains **why** GoW RPG exists, **what problems** it solves, and **how** it should work from a product perspective. It provides context for product decisions and helps anyone (AI agents, developers, stakeholders) understand the problem space and user needs.

## Why This Project Exists

### Market Opportunity
1. **Browser Gaming Gap**: Most action RPGs require downloads/installs; few offer quality browser-based experiences
2. **Mobile-First**: Growing mobile gaming market in Southeast Asia (especially Vietnam)
3. **PWA Potential**: Progressive Web Apps enable app-like experiences without app store friction
4. **Quick Sessions**: Players want engaging games they can play in 5-15 minute sessions

### Player Needs
1. **Accessibility**: Play anywhere, anytime, no download required
2. **Instant Gratification**: Jump into action immediately, no long tutorials
3. **Progression**: Feel meaningful advancement (levels, skills, maps)
4. **Customization**: Choose playstyle through skill selection
5. **Localization**: Play in native language (Vietnamese primary audience)

### Technical Vision
1. **Simplicity**: Prove that quality games don't need complex build toolchains
2. **Performance**: Demonstrate PWA can achieve 60fps on mobile
3. **Modularity**: Show how to build maintainable game architecture with vanilla JS
4. **Open Web**: Leverage web standards (ES modules, WebGL, WebAudio, Service Workers)

## Problems Being Solved

### For Players
1. **Barrier to Entry**: No download, no install, no account required ‚Äî just play
2. **Storage Constraints**: No device storage consumed (PWA caching is minimal)
3. **Language Barriers**: Fully localized Vietnamese experience (rare for indie games)
4. **Performance Issues**: Optimized for mid-range mobile devices (not just high-end)
5. **Engagement**: Dynamic enemy spawning keeps combat intense and engaging

### For Developers
1. **Build Complexity**: No webpack/vite/rollup ‚Äî pure ES modules
2. **Dependency Hell**: Minimal dependencies (just Three.js, bundled locally)
3. **Maintainability**: Modular architecture makes systems easy to understand and modify
4. **Extensibility**: Data-driven skills/maps allow content addition without code refactors
5. **Localization**: i18n system makes adding languages straightforward

### For Business
1. **Distribution**: PWA + TWA enables Google Play distribution without native app
2. **Updates**: Instant updates via service worker (no app store approval delays)
3. **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for desktop and mobile
4. **Analytics**: Web-based analytics easier than native app tracking
5. **Monetization**: Web Payment API integration for in-app purchases

## Product Principles

### Design Principles
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action has clear visual/audio response
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce features gradually, not all at once
3. **Fail-Safe**: No punishing mechanics, death just respawns in village
4. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Simple, readable UI over fancy effects
5. **Mobile-First**: Design for touch, enhance for desktop (not vice versa)

### Content Principles
1. **Data-Driven**: Skills, maps, enemies defined in data, not hardcoded
2. **Localization-Ready**: All text uses translation keys, never hardcoded strings
3. **Extensible**: Adding content shouldn't require architecture changes
4. **Balanced**: Skills should feel powerful but not trivialize content
5. **Varied**: Maps should feel different (visuals, enemy types, difficulty)

### Technical Principles
1. **Performance First**: 60fps is non-negotiable on target devices
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce quality on low-end devices, don't crash
3. **Offline-Capable**: Core game works without network (after first load)
4. **Stateless Where Possible**: Minimize global state, prefer pure functions
5. **Fail Loudly in Dev**: Use DEBUG mode to catch issues early
